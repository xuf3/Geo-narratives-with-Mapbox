Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, India and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and India, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

With that being said the more we frequent these comfortable shoes the quicker we wear the bottom out of the heel to where we no longer want to slip into them. R Place is one such bar that I believe has wore me out. There is a lot of fun to be had at R Place when you first start going to the bar; current top 40 hits are played on the dance floor, strong drinks that would equal two or possibly three at other bars are being thrown at patrons and their are a lot of attractive people to be seen. As time goes on and you frequent the bar more you start to realize that you have the sudden feeling of familiarity with every person you come in contact with. This isnt because you had some wild night with numerous people throughout the bar, which is out of the question as R Place is the perfect bar to experience the legendary Seattle Freeze. This familiarity comes because the same exact people and groups of people are ALWAYS at R Place. These wolf packs of gay men roam through out the bar hungry to make their presence known by always barking the loudest. Each group generally has an alpha wolf which the others of the group follow like hungry pups behind. This alpha is the nucleus of the group; he dictates where the group stands, where the group gets a drink and when the group makes their way to the dance floor. This alpha also usually has a bloated ego and sense of importance which his young pups are drawn to because of the wide spectrum of insecurities that they all possess.", "rating": "Loves it"}, "10": {"username": "mike98312", "review": "Don't bother is right\nThis club used to cater to the twink and mild hip hop/pop crowd with an atmosphere that catetred to the more wealthy business class gay crowd.

Their shows went down the crapper when they brought the california style here as It mostly caters to illlegal immigrants. Stay away from R place it's a scam besides most of the men in there act and look like women literally they really should just redecorate and call it a straight bar but that would be stupid as the gay people would mingle with the straight crowd and cause fights and more controversy to Seattle's already growing problem with street crime. Yes r place is a screwed up place now for the gay community I went there for halloween 2010 people were extremely rude, drinks watered down and expensive, the go go dancers gave me dirty looks and danced in a rude fashion that made me feel uncomfortable and molested thus insenuated that I was a paedofile as they made physical references to how children would look like if they were forced to work as sex workers.", "rating": "Hates it"}, "11": {"username": "stuartminnesota", "review": "Don't go there\nEvery couple of years I visit Seattle, one of my favorite cities and have always stopped in at R-Place.

One guy seemed like he was nice at first and telling us about people there have respect and so on. Saying that if you don't like that people are trying to join in and you say no then they will respect that, WRONG. That guy was scheming something from the beginning. We couldn't get a room because it was so packed, so we tried doing some stuff in the dark room. We were alone at one point which was nice. One guy was laying on a swing which we didn't mind him, till some people noticed us doing stuff that everyone was trying to join in and that was a total turn off and I had to tell them no and what not. I was getting pissed. I mean watching is okay but trying to get on it is not okay or tricking people so they can have their way fuck that. We are NEVER going to a gay bath house EVER!

As a tip, request the \"Sling rooms\" if they are available. Even if you never ever use a sling, these rooms are much more centrally located, so there is considerably more walk past traffic.

I've been there maybe a half dozen times, scattered over as many years, and overall, I'd have to say that the place is consistently a bit disappointing. The whole time, I've only messed around with a couple guys there (and they were both young and h-o-t) but they were the exception. I thought adding a steam room would be a good move but it really doesn't make up for everything else. The top floor seems to be reserved for the heavy duty party guys, and I'm not talking about Tupperware boys. I'm sure there must be some occasional sex, but for the most part it's a rather unhealthy looking assortment that seem to know each other and appear to be collectively bored. Some are decked out in leather thongs, a surprising number are staring into the glow of laptops, and someone will occasionally climb into a sling, but nothing ever seems to happen. The third floor also has a nearly pitch black maze with a collection of benches to trip over. The only thing creepier than the maze is the lingering fetid odor wafting in the hall. Creepy in that the bathroom is kept mostly clean, and the nasty smell seems to live in the hallway. The second floor has a fairly big video room, with like five off-color flat screens mounted uncomfortably high for watching the porn. The seating is built in along the walls, recreating the awkward feel of a school gym prom dance. Nobody dances here either. The first floor is where the steam room is (and the best feature of the whole place). There's also showers & lockers, and down the hall is the TV/computer room where the homeless people tend to hang out and watch Fox Sports.
